# Image Classification | ResNET

## Overview

This project aims to develop an advanced image classification system enhanced with neural style transfer techniques. By leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as ResNet, VGG, or MobileNet, the system will not only classify images but also apply artistic styles to them, creating visually appealing results while maintaining high classification accuracy.

## Key Objectives

1. **Image Classification:**

   - Implement and fine-tune pre-trained CNN models to classify images from a custom dataset accurately.
   - Evaluate model performance and optimize for higher accuracy and efficiency.

2. **Neural Style Transfer:**
   - Integrate neural style transfer algorithms to apply artistic styles to images.
   - Ensure seamless integration with the image classification system, allowing for both functionalities to operate together.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries and Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV
- **Tools:** GitHub for version control, Trello for task management, Notion for documentation, GitHub Actions for CI/CD
